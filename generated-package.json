        "body": "Start by creating your guest list and menu. Consider dietary restrictions and age groups. Plan your shopping list around crowd-pleasers: burgers and hot dogs for kids, plus elevated options like marinated chicken or vegetable skewers for adults. Don't forget sides that work at room temperature."

        "heading": "Grill Setup and Heat Zones",
        "body": "The secret to BBQ success lies in mastering heat zones. Create a two-zone fire: high heat for searing and low heat for gentle cooking. This technique lets you handle multiple foods simultaneously while preventing overcooking. Test your zones with the hand method - high heat allows 2-3 seconds of hand-hovering, medium allows 4-5 seconds."

      {
        "heading": "The Essential Grilling Timeline",
        "body": "Start with items that take longest: thick cuts of meat first, then chicken, followed by burgers and hot dogs. Remember that resting the meat for 5-10 minutes after cooking allows juices to redistribute, ensuring every bite is perfectly tender. Use this time to warm buns and prep final garnishes."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Kid-Friendly Zone Setup",
        "body": "Create a dedicated space away from the grill with activities and easy-to-eat foods. Pre-cut fruits, cheese cubes, and individual drink cups prevent spills and keep little ones happy while adults enjoy the main event."
      },
      {
        "heading": "Finishing Touches That Wow",
        "body": "Presentation matters. Use colorful plates, set up a DIY topping station, and create ambient lighting with string lights or lanterns. These details transform a simple cookout into a memorable gathering that guests will talk about long after the last burger is served."
